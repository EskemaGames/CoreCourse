The idea of this architecture is to have all your essential tools in a way that's flexible and easy to use.

This is a completely different way of doing things, focusing on the basics and standard knowledge, and AVOIDING Unity
as much as possible for trivial tasks, like using json instead of scriptble objects, or avoiding other included systems
like translations, avoiding coroutines, etc.

We use the engine when we have to, nothing else.

The code is flexible, and easy to create lots of variants without entering in dangerous or complex if-else cases


We are NOT using here as we DON'T need them:
-scriptable objects
-translation system


We are building our own systems to be in control, to have code that can be easily ported to any engine
that uses C#, cause we are not tying up our code to Unity
