The idea of this architecture is to have all your essential tools in a way that's flexible and easy to use, 
furthermore, a system that DOESN'T use Unity at all but for the essential things.

We are NOT using here as we DON'T need them:
-scriptable objects
-translation system


We are building our own systems to be in control, to have code that can be easily ported to any engine
that uses C#, cause we are not tying up our code to Unity
