// CORE VERSION 1.0

//
// DOTWEEN 
// REWIRED 
// NGUI 

// core framework it's just the foundation for your games
// it provides you with screens (for UI), timers, scenes to manage,
// language manager, sound manager, etc
// it's NOT meant to be modified unless you do it to improve
// the existing codebase (or to fix bugs).
//
// so, NO specific game code should be added to any single file within the CoreFramework folder
//
//
// In order to add Rewired support, then add USE_REWIRED to preprocessor directive in build settings
// In order to add NGUI support, then add USE_NGUI to preprocessor directive in build settings
